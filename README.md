<h2 align='justify'>Welcome to Falconize - Falcon 9 Landing Prediction</h2>

<br>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this capstone, I predict the success of the Falcon 9 first stage landing. SpaceX's innovative approach allows them to reuse the first stage, resulting in significant cost savings. Falconize aims to determine if the first stage will land successfully, providing insights into launch costs. This information is invaluable for companies bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches.</p>
